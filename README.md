![Lesson1](https://github.com/nataliereshetnikova/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_linux_cli/task_linux.jpg)

# what was new to me
More than a half of commands from the CodeAcademy course were new to me. After compleeting the tasks I feel more confident in using them.
HTTP protocols articles are overwelming for understanding at once, I guess will return to them once again.

# what surprised me
I am surprised on that actually it is possible to configure the environment, I thought thas staff should be standartized for everyone.
ALso, it is so great that such a high-quality free resourse avaible online to learn the basics.

# what I am intend to use in future
This is the hardest question because I am not sure about my future intentions yet on where to use all this stuff)

# what was new to me
Pretty much from the content of this part repetes the very first part on Udacity, but it feels like repeating is important to get used to using version control system.

# what surprised me
Really loved the way on how the difficult stuff is explained in simple words.

# what I am intend to use in future
I guess the knowledge is applicable for day-to-day use.
