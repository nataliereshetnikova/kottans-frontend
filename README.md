# what was new to me
More than a half of commands from the CodeAcademy course were new to me. After compleeting the tasks I feel more confident in using them.
HTTP protocols articles are overwelming for understanding at once, I guess will return to them once again.

# what surprised me
I am surprised on that actually it is possible to configure the environment, I thought thas staff should be standartized for everyone.
ALso, it is so great that such a high-quality free resourse avaible online to learn the basics.

# what I am intend to use in future
This is the hardest question because I am not sure about my future intentions yet on where to use all this stuff)
